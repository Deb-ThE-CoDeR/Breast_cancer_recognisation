# Breast_cancer_recognisation

This Project is define a model that can predict whether the breast cell is cancerious or not.So I have used deep learning .The library used in the coding is Tensorflow.Keras is imported from that tensorflow.So we import load_breast_cancer dataset from sklearn.datasets.Then we define the main data and the target data. we train and test X and y.We devide the whole dataset into train and test with a ratio 8:2.Then we create a Sequential model and add Dense and layer.We then compile the model with binary cross entropy loss and the our model is ready to fit using X_train and y_train. then we evaluate the accuracy with y_test. and if the value is greater than 0.5 then the cell is malignant that is cancerious and if the value is less than 0.5 then the cell is benien that is non cancerious.
